# LoginApp

Test Application from lesson 2.03

The first screen of the LoginViewController is responsible for user authorization. The second screen of the WelcomeViewController displays the name and logout button.
The username is passed to the second screen when navigating from the authorization screen through the prepare method.
When entering a username, auto-correction and predictive input are disabled. When entering a password, the entered characters are hidden.
On the keyboard, the Return key has been renamed to Next when entering a username, and to Done when entering a password.
When you click on the Next button, the cursor moves to the password field. As long as the password field is empty, the Done button is disabled.
You can hide the keyboard by tapping on the screen. 
Preset username - User, password - Password.
The application is built on UIKit.
